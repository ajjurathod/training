 Lesson : Glue Job Failures Due to Missing IAM Permissions
                                                                                            
Issue Faced: AWS Glue jobs were failing intermittently with access denied errors.                             Root Cause :     IAM role attached to Glue lacked fine-grained S3 permissions on specific buckets (S3-B, S3-C). Lesson Learned:     Always use the principle of least privilege, but ensure necessary actions (`s3:GetObject`, `PutObject`, `ListBucket`) are covered for all target buckets.
Action Taken: Created a Glue-specific IAM policy template and validated with `IAM Access Analyzer`.                                                                    
Lesson 2: Replication to Region 2 Failing Without Notification
Issue faced: Cross-region S3 replication (Region 1 to Region 2) failed silently without notifocation
Lesson learned: Always Set up CloudWatch + EventBridge alerts for replication failures.
Action taken: Configured cloudwatch and eventbridge for cross regional notification

Lesson 3 :No Automated Alerting for Glue/Lambda/Athena Failures	
Issue Faced: Failures in data pipeline components (Glue jobs, Lambda errors) weren’t noticed until customers reported.
Root Cause: No CloudWatch alarms or centralized logging/alerting was configured.                                Lesson Learned: Always configure CloudWatch alarms + EventBridge + SNS notifications for key ETL components.    Action Taken: Alarms and notification pipelines added to all critical services. 

Lesson 4: CloudTrail Was Enabled But Not Logging S3 Data Events
Issue faced: CloudTrail was logging only management events, and not capturing S3 data-level activity  (e.g., GetObject, PutObject) 
Root cause: CloudTrail was configured only for management events, not data events, which are off by default for S3.
lesson learned: Always configure data event logging for critical S3 buckets to track fine-grained object-level activity
action taken: Updated CloudTrail configuration to include data events for all ETL-related S3 buckets

Issue Faced	Lifecycle policies not correctly configured, causing increased storage cost
Root Cause	The team missed applying cost-saving Glacier transition rules during deployment
Lesson Learned	Standardize lifecycle policies as part of baseline S3 setup
Action Taken	Updated internal checklist and CloudFormation templates to include default lifecycle policies


Lesson : Unexpected EBS Snapshot Costs Due to Frequent DLM Execution

Issue Faced	Backup costs spiked due to overly aggressive Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) snapshot schedule.
Root Cause	Snapshot frequency was set to every hour for large EBS volumes, even during idle periods.
Lesson Learned	Tune DLM policies based on usage patterns; non-production environments don’t need frequent snapshots.
Action Taken	Revised snapshot frequency to daily; added tagging strategy to differentiate prod/dev and apply                separate DLM policies.
Impact	       Reduced snapshot storage costs by 40%; cleaner backup management. 


Lesson : Unused EBS Snapshots Accumulated Over Time
Aspect	Details
Issue Faced	A significant portion of monthly cost was due to unused EBS snapshots that were no longer relevant.
Root Cause	Snapshots were created via automation but not regularly audited or deleted.
Lesson Learned	Implement periodic review and automation for snapshot retention using AWS Backup or lifecycle scripts.
Action Taken	Scheduled cleanup scripts to delete snapshots older than retention policy, and adopted AWS Backup.
Impact	Reduced EBS snapshot costs and maintained better compliance with data retention policies.



 Lesson : No Data Encryption Logging Enabled for Compliance

Issue Faced	Customer security audit flagged lack of logging for encryption and KMS usage on S3 and EBS.
Root Cause	CloudTrail was enabled, but data events for S3 and EBS encryption actions weren’t being logged.
Lesson Learned	Enable full data event logging in CloudTrail for all storage services with KMS integration.
Action Taken	Updated CloudTrail config to include S3 data events and EBS volume-level encryption logging.
Impact	Passed compliance audit; strengthened traceability and governance across regions.  


 Lesson  Unstructured S3 Bucket Naming Made Management Harder

Issue Faced	Hard to manage and monitor S3 buckets due to inconsistent naming and tagging.
Root Cause	No enforced bucket naming standard across deployments.
Lesson Learned	Enforce naming convention (e.g., client-name-env-purpose-region) and tagging (e.g., cost center, team, compliance level).
Action Taken	Added automated naming convention enforcement and cost allocation tags to IaC templates.
Impact	Easier cost allocation, improved governance, simpler monitoring and reporting. 

Lesson : No Cost Visibility for Glacier and Instant Retrieval Classes
Aspect	Details
Issue Faced	S3 Glacier and Instant Retrieval storage tiers were used, but costs were not broken down clearly for the customer.
Root Cause	Lack of cost allocation tags and storage class filters in Cost Explorer.
Lesson Learned	Apply cost allocation tags and separate reporting for each S3 storage class.
Action Taken	Implemented detailed tagging and trained customer to use AWS Cost Explorer filters.
Impact	Improved transparency with customers, enabled accurate billing and budgeting.

EXLL-036 - Cost Budget Alert Not Configured
One environment exceeded monthly AWS budget due to large EBS snapshot growth, but no alerts were triggered.
Lesson Learned: Always configure AWS Budgets with email/SNS alerts, and monitor snapshot growth using AWS Cost Explorer & Trusted Advisor.  

Lesson 10: Missing Tagging on S3 Buckets Caused Tracking Issues
Issue Faced: Unable to track S3 storage costs accurately by project or environment.
Lesson Learned: Apply mandatory resource tagging policy across S3 buckets and storage classes.
Action Taken: Enforced tagging at bucket creation through SCP + Organization Tag Policies. Added billing alerts by tag.
