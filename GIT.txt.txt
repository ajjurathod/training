   (Commit ID will change only of new commit of the that branch)
16)git remote add origin <repo url> - Used to link between local git repository and remote repository

35) git cherrypick <commit id> - It will get the changes from one branch to another branch
36) git commit --amend -we will able to rewrite the commit history
37) git pull -get the changes from remote repository to local repository
38) git fetch -Downloads changes from remote without modifying the working directory
        (Stores files in backened memory ..To get thise files run GIT MERGER ORIGIN/MASTER)
39) git branch -r - list the branches in remote repository
40) git branch -a -Lists all the branches in remote and local repository
41) git restore <file-name> == to restore the before STAGING and commiting
42) git checkout -- <file-name> == to restore the files of staging but before commiting
